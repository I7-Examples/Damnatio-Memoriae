<br>

<br>
The window is outside from the Water Study and inside from the Outdoors. It is a door. It is open and scenery. The description of the window is &quot;<font color=#000080>A square window giving onto flat ground.</font>&quot;  It is not openable.
<br>

<br>
After going to the Outdoors from the Water Study:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Any other direction would be unsafe at the moment, so you climb gingerly out the window...</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
After going to the Water Study from the Outdoors:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You clamber back over the windowsill.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue the action.
<br>

<br>
Before inserting something into the window: try throwing the noun out the window instead.
<br>

<br>
Before going outside with something (called the burden): try throwing the burden out the window instead.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>throw [something] out/through [window]</font>&quot; as throwing it out. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>push [something] out/through [window]</font>&quot; as throwing it out.
<br>

<br>
Throwing it out is an action applying to two things.
<br>

<br>
Check throwing it out:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not pushable between rooms and the noun is not carried by the player
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>(first taking [the noun])[line break]</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not carried by the player, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is fragile and the noun is not protected by something sturdy, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The noun] won't survive the trip.</font>&quot; instead.
<br>

<br>
Carry out throwing it out:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the noun to the Outdoors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Report throwing it out:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You casually toss [the noun] out of the window; perhaps you'll be able to collect it later.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of searching the window: say &quot;<font color=#000080>There's little to see: the island is extremely flat and offers little other civilization, and no escape besides the ships that carry your enemies. Running away will do no good.</font>&quot;
