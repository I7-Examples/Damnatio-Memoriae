<br>
The endgame rules are a rulebook.
<br>

<br>
Started printing is a number that varies. Started printing is 0.
<br>

<br>
A person can be apparently guilty or apparently innocent. The player is apparently innocent.

<br>
An endgame rule:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the soldiers can see the corpse

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;

A thing can be recovered or ordinary. A thing is usually ordinary.

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Damn him to a little black crisp. But he goes on, simpering and murmuring out his story, much embellished, about all your strange magical activities, some of which are astonishingly perverse, and not in the line of scholarship at all.[paragraph break]</font>&quot;;

</font><font color=#000080>Never too quick on first waking, Clemens. He doesn't say anything at first, and then he starts muttering incoherently about how he doesn't know what Tiberius wants. Obviously it hasn't even occurred to him that his identity has been mistaken.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>It isn't yours, though. That's the main thing. You live, free; take his name, and travel as a member of the servant class, for now. There will be time enough to change that later. One of these days you may even make it back as far as Rome.</font>&quot;;
