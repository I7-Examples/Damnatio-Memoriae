<br>

<br>
<b>Book 1 - Putting Something Under</b>
<br>

<br>
Underlying relates various things to one thing.
<br>

<br>
The verb to underlie (he underlies, they underlie, he underlay, it is underlaid, he is underlying) implies the underlying relation.
<br>

<br>
Instead of looking under a thing which is underlaid by something (called the lost object):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You reach around under [the noun] and turn up [list of things which underlie the noun].</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with item running through the things which underlie the noun
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item does not underlie anything;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is carried by the player;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat;
<br>

<br>
Hiding it under is an action applying to two things.
<br>

<br>
Definition: a thing is concealing if it is underlaid by something.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>put [something] under [something]</font>&quot; as hiding it under. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hide [something] under [something]</font>&quot; as hiding it under. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hide [something] in [something]</font>&quot; as hiding it under.
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hide under [something]</font>&quot; as hiding under. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>hide in [something]</font>&quot; as hiding under.
<br>

<br>
Instead of hiding something under Clemens:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Bad idea. There's always the risk that he'll roll over or get up or something.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Check hiding it under:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the second noun is not fixed in place, say &quot;<font color=#000080>[The second noun] wouldn't be a very effective place of concealment.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not carried by the player and the noun is not the player
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>(first taking [the noun])[line break]</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silently try taking the noun;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the noun is not carried by the player, stop the action;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>

<br>
Carry out hiding it under:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the noun underlies the second noun;
<br>

<br>
Report hiding it under:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You shove [the noun] out of sight beneath [the second noun].</font>&quot; 
<br>

<br>
Hiding under is an action applying to one thing. 
<br>

<br>
Carry out hiding under:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try hiding the player under the noun. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of hiding the player under something:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You are too large by far.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of hiding the player under the haystack:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Without some decoy, they'll certainly look hard enough to find you.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of hiding the player under the haystack when Clemens protects the player:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>Either they'll be convinced by Clemens or they won't; if they aren't, the haystack will not protect you, and it will only detract from your dignity to be found under there.</font>&quot;
