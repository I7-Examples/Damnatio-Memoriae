Before labor when the noun is a liquid or the second noun is a liquid: say &quot;<span class="quote">You have no such powers over liquids.</span>&quot; instead. A liquid has some text called the spilling description. The spilling description of a liquid is usually &quot;<span class="quote">spills out on the ground, and soon soaks in</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">The lamp is a lit container carried by the player.

The lamp contains a quantity of oil. The oil is a liquid. Instead of doing something to the oil, say &quot;<span class="quote">The oil is busily burning.</span>&quot; The lamp resembles the pitcher. The spilling description of the oil is &quot;<span class="quote">spills on the ground, where it spreads fast -- you briefly worry that you're about to set something on fire -- but the flames soon flicker out and the oil itself soaks in</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of inserting something into the lamp:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The lamp is oily, and needs no other contents.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">empty [</span><span class="substitution">something</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; as emptying. Emptying is an action applying to one thing. Check emptying: if the noun is a person, say &quot;<span class="quote">A disturbing notion worthy of a Gaul.</span>&quot; instead; if the noun is not a container, say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">The noun</span><span class="quote">] [</span><span class="substitution">are</span><span class="quote">] incapable of containment in any case.</span>&quot; instead; if the noun does not contain something, say &quot;<span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">The noun</span><span class="quote">] [</span><span class="substitution">are</span><span class="quote">] already empty.</span>&quot; instead. Carry out emptying: now every thing in the noun is in the location.
