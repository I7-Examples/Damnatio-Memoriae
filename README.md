# Damnatio Memoriae

An Inform 7 Standard Example

## Description

14 AD. Agrippa Postumus, grandson of the recently-deceased Augustus, tries to avoid death at the hands of the next emperor, Tiberius. At his disposal: a couple of old manuscripts, a lamp, and a recalcitrant slave. And a powerful knowledge of the Art of Venus Genetrix, of course -- the magic eventually known as the Lavori d'Aracne.

Damnatio Memoriae belongs to a series with the author's previous game Savoir-Faire; though it can stand alone, the game's mechanics will make most sense to players already familiar with that work. 

It is a fast, timed game, taking only a few minutes to play once, but probably requiring multiple attempts to bring to a satisfactory conclusion.

## Development

The Source Text is compatible with Inform 7 build 6M62.

The Story File Format should be set to Blorbed Z-Code version 8.
